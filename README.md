**Stephan Wong's Portfolio**


Hi!  Im new to github and learning the ways of fullstack developemnt.  I am currently in studying at MITxPro in a quest to obtain the full stack certificate.   

This page was created to try to satisfy a portfolio project.  At the currrent moment only written using .css. html and javascript. 

I had some prior experience with web development in the early 2000s where it was just html.  I am finding out there are more things toolkits for applications and web development.  I plan on to use the more new technology such as bootstrap, and anyother tools that I may come across.

If you would like to know more about the class I am currently taking, you can visit online.
